  <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
  <p>
    Broadly, I'm curious about why physicians behave the way they do: how do they make decisions? Is evidence-based medicine as evidenced-based as advertised? How do costs and reimbursements factor into decision-making (and what is the cost for that)? How do different circumstances and environments change physician behavior? I have a particular interest in antibiotic stewardship and its effects on patient outcomes. I also enjoy staying up-to-date on recent developments in biologics and computational technology in medicine.

    Before medical school, my main research interests were in biochemistry and translational research. I've worked in infectious diseases, cardiology, and genomics.

      Albinism is rare, but  disproportionately prevalent in certain regions of Africa, where people with albinism (PWA) face a variety of medical and social challenges. In the first study of PWA in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we found a high prevalence of nonmelanoma skin cancers, low use of sun-protective measures, and frequent societal discrimination, compounded by political and infrastructural instability. However, we also found a high rate of cure for skin cancers, demonstrating the impact that a small, dedicated albinism clinic can make on a local population.

      A national NPR survey found that half of patients who couldn't see their doctor when they needed care cited night or weekend accessibility issues, yet little is known about the sociodemographic characteristics of patients using weekend visits. Using a large national public database, we show that Hispanic patients and those living in wealthier, less rural areas were more likely to utilize weekend visits. However, the absolute differences were small, suggesting that expanded hours would be welcome across the sociodemographic spectrum.

      What are the challenges of using Google Trends data as a digital epidemiological approach? In our reply to a study demonstrating that increased air pollution was correlated with increased search interest for &ldquo;<i>itch</i>&rdquo;, we show that the same study done with an extended study period and a more geographically discrete analysis found no correlations. Importantly, we argue that analyzing air quality data at the state-level poses interpretability challenges due to the heterogeneity of environments within each state.

      Although many patients use social media for information, the credentials of dermatology influencers on Instagram remained unknown. In this review of Instagram content labeled with dermatology-related tags, we found that board-certified dermatologists comprised &lt;5% of dermatology influencers, and that nearly all influencers featured promotional material. Given the potential for misinformation and conflicts of interest, these findings serve as a call for dermatology organizations to push back with their own high quality content.

      Increasing evidence suggests that concurrent use of antibiotics worsens the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a type of cancer therapy. In the largest retrospective study to date on this topic, we found decreased survival in patients with stage III or IV melanoma who received antibiotics just prior to initiation of ICI. Interestingly, we also found increased incidence of colitis with antibiotic treatment, suggesting that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis could have mediated the change in ICI efficacy. Given the high usage of antibiotics, physicians should be judicious with their use in patients likely to receive ICI.

      Many physicians provide instructions to patients for simple wound care on their clinic webpages. Building off our findings that physicians frequently (and unnecessarily) prescribe topical antibiotics after simple skin procedures, we studied whether this trend was reflected in those online instructions. By looking at the webpages of the top non-dermatologist utilizers of biopsies, we demonstrate that many physicians are not only prescribing such antibiotics, but also educating patients that antibiotics are needed for wound healing. Such instructions reinforce persistent myths of simple wound care.

      Simple skin protectants like petroleum jelly are sufficient for wound care after skin biopsies or excision. Yet, patients are routinely sent home with topical antibiotics instead. We use a national public database to quantify this practice, demonstrating that physicians (especially dermatologists) are increasingly sending patients home with topical antibiotics. At best, this is unnecessary; at worst, this increases adverse reactions and antibiotic overuse.

      Physicians frequently use drugs for indications other than those listed on their labels, often driven by low financial incentives by pharmaceutical companies to investigate every possible use of a drug. We use a national public database to show that off-label prescribing is widespread in dermatology, even for common conditions like acne, which could be problematic considering Medicare often excludes off-label prescribing for coverage determination.

      How can we use our understanding of metabolic biochemistry to build a better point-of-care diagnostic for tuberculosis? We designed fluorogenic trehalose analogs that stain live bacteria in minutes upon incorporation into the cell wall, with minimal background noise and no need for sample washing. This chemically stable agent presents a new approach for designing rapid sputum-based TB tests for low-resource environments.
