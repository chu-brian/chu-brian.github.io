<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p>
    Currently, I'm working with <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20002840/p4501453">Dr. Nick Lukens</a> on a clinical research project investigating the effects of antibiotics on immunotherapy for melanoma. Current translational research on the microbiome is incredibly exciting, and scientists are finding more and more linkages between microbiome activity and human health. Perhaps antibiotics-induced dysbiosis may have a linkage to how well patients respond to immunotherapy!
</p>    
<p>
    Broadly, I'm curious about why physicians behave the way they do: how do they make decisions? Is evidence-based medicine as evidenced-based as advertised? How do costs and reimbursements factor into decision-making (and what is the cost for that)? How do different circumstances and environments change physician behavior? I also enjoy staying up-to-date on recent developments in biologics and computational technology in medicine.

    Before medical school, my main research interests were in biochemistry and translational research. I've worked in infectious diseases, cardiology, and genomics.

    Physicians frequently use drugs for indications other than those listed on their labels, often driven by low financial incentives by pharmaceutical companies to investigate every possible use of a drug. We use a national public database to show that off-label prescribing is widespread in dermatology, even for common conditions like acne, which could be problematic considering Medicare often excludes off-label prescribing for coverage determination.

    How can we use our understanding of metabolic biochemistry to build a better point-of-care diagnostic for tuberculosis? We designed fluorogenic trehalose analogs that stain live bacteria in minutes upon incorporation into the cell wall, with minimal background noise and no need for sample washing. This chemically stable agent presents a new approach for designing rapid sputum-based TB tests for low-resource environments.
